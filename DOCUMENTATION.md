# Documenation

A documentation about folder structures and pitfalls I had while creating this boilerplate

## Folder Structure

- src - All the code that drives your application is settled here.
- src/databae - Databaseservices and other things that work directly with the database should be located here.
- src/entites - All database entities are located here.
- src/schema - All Graphql related things are located in this folder.
- src/schema/resolvers - All resolvers go here (At the moment only one, extend them if you need it)
- src/schema/types - All Type definition of Graphql are stored here.

## Pitfalls

I write them down as soon as i recognize them or they happen to me again :D
